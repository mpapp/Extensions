Micrometeoroids in the Solar system are distributed in a variety of populations, whose abundance has been mater of debate for the last decades. Most of the models of dust populations PMID:1304383 in the inner Solar System presume asteroid collisions and short-period Jupiter family comets to be the dominant sources of dust. In addition, a clear dynamical signature of sub-micron sized dust originating from outside the Solar System was observed by in-situ dust instruments. Beyond 5AU, little is known about the origin, dynamics and flux, as well as about the size and speed distribution of the dust. This is because only four spacecrafts equipped with in-situ dust detectors have explored this region so far, while optical observations are difficult due to the very low optical depth of the dust in this region. Previous attempts to estimate the ring exposure age assumed that highly inclined and eccentric cometary grains dominate the micrometeoroid environment in the outer Solar System, resulting in a ring exposure age of</p></div>
